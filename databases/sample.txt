McCallister was born in Toledo, Ohio, on May 3, 1934. The McCallister family moved to Corona, California, and joined the San Gabriel Country Club. He started playing golf when he was 14 years old, after his father Don urged him to have a go at the sport.

McCallister was awarded a scholarship to attend the University of Southern California. There, he earned All-American honors three times as a member of the golf team â€“ first-team in 1956 and 1957, third-team in 1958. He was the first (and, at the time of his death, the only) player to win both the Pac-8 Conference and Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference titles in back-to-back seasons.
