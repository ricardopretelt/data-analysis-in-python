## Description

This is a collection of methods and commands used in basic python libraries in statistics and data analysis. Some of the commands and strategies for data analysis and numerical handling I found them while studying my courses in [codecademy](codecademy.com) and [udacity](udacity.com). Look the sites and official documentation for more information.

The objectives of this project are:

* To be a friendly initiation for a beginner to data analysis with python.
* A review to quickly remember how to use the different libraries.

## Tools & Dependencies

The Python libraries used are:
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scipy
* ipython-sql with sqlite3
* Scikit-learn
