## Description

This is a collection of notebooks about the distinct uses of the basic python libraries in statistics and data analysis. Some of the commands and strategies for data analysis and numerical handling I found them while studying my courses in [codecademy](codecademy.com) and [udacity](udacity.com). Look the sites and official documentation for more information.

The objectives of this project are:

* To be a friendly initiation for a beginner to data analysis with python.
* A review to quickly remember how to use the different libraries.
